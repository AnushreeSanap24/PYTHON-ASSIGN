    "ANSWER 1:\n",
    "Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user.\n",
    "For example: When we use the TV remote to increase the volume. We don't know how pressing a key increases the volume of the TV. We only know to press the \"+\" button to increase the volume. That is exactly the abstraction that works in the object-oriented concept.\n",

    "ANSWER 2:\n",
    " Abstraction is hiding the details and implementation of the code. Encapsulation is hiding the data and controlling the visibility of the code.\n",

    " ANSWER 3:\n",
    "The 'abc' module in Python library provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes. 'abc' works by marking methods of the base class as abstract. This is done by @absttractmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER 4:\n",
    "In Python, abstraction can be achieved by having/using abstract classes and methods in our programs. Understanding Abstract Methods and Classes: An abstract method is a method that is declared, but does not contain implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER 5:\n",
    "We cannot create an abstract class in Python directly. However, Python does provide a module that allows us to define abstract classes. The module we can use to create an abstract class in Python is abc(abstract base class) module\n"
