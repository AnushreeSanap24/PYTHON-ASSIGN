    "Inheritance is a method through which one class inherits the properties from its parent class. Inheritance is a feature in which one new class is derived from the existing ones.\n",
    "1.Single inheritance\n",
    "In this inheritance, a derived class is created from a single base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given example, Class A is the parent class and Class B is the child class since Class B inherits the features and behavior of the parent class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Multi-level inheritance\n",
    "In this inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given example, class c inherits the properties and behavior of class B and class B inherits the properties and behavior of class B. So, here A is the parent class of B and class B is the parent class of C. So, here class C implicitly inherits the properties and behavior of class A along with Class B i.e there is a multilevel of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Multiple inheritance\n",
    "In this inheritance, a derived class is created from more than one base class. This inheritance is not supported by .NET Languages like C#, F#, etc., and Java Language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given example, class c inherits the properties and behavior of class B and class A at the same level. So, here A and Class B both are the parent classes for Class C.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Multipath inheritance\n",
    "In this inheritance, a derived class is created from other derived classes and the same base class of other derived classes. This inheritance is not supported by .NET Languages like C#, F#, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given example, class D inherits the properties and behavior of class C and class B as well as Class A. Both class C and class B inherit the Class A. So, Class A is the parent for Class B and Class C as well as Class D. So it's making it a Multipath inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
    "In this inheritance, more than one derived class is created from a single base class and further child classes act as parent classes for more than one child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given example, class A has two children class B and class D. Further, class B and class C both are having two children - class D and E; class F and G respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Hybrid inheritance\n",
    "This is a combination of more than one inheritance. Hence, it may be a combination of Multilevel and Multiple inheritance or Hierarchical and Multilevel inheritance Hierarchical and Multipath inheritance, or Hierarchical, Multilevel and Multiple inheritances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since .NET Languages like C#, F#, etc. do not support multiple and multipath inheritance. Hence hybrid inheritance with a combination of multiple or multipath inheritances is not supported by .NET Languages."
